# Meaning of your task is : I have to develop a backend to deal with DoS(denial of service) where I have 
to prevent websit from exploiting from scammers to limit a request (1 request per second and 20 request
per minutes)

# dependencies:
express js,
dotenv

# How I deal with this task:
Backend :-
In backend I divided it into 3 part:-
1.controllers
2.middleware
3.other important file likes(node module , env,etc)

controllers:-
This is the important directory where the base file stored (FinTarget.js).
In this file all the important dependencies exports

middleware:-
In middleware I have attempt to manage the code easier.
* taking userId
* making request
* manage the request if request is more than 20 stop it.

# Frontend:-

I have develop a frontend part to manage the backend simply where I make the 2 APIs and manage the backend
with it .
In the output section I have changing the output constantly to make the thinking easier
